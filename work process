1. The first line #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler to include the stdio.h header file, which contains definitions for standard input/output functions such as printf() and scanf().
2.The next line int main() declares the function main(), which is the entry point for all C programs.
3.The line float fahrenheit, celsius; declares two variables, fahrenheit and celsius, to store the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius respectively.
4.The line printf("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "); prints a message to the console, asking the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit.
5.The line scanf("%f", &fahrenheit); reads the user input and stores it in the variable fahrenheit.
6.The line // Formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is a comment, which is ignored by the compiler.
7.The line celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9; calculates the temperature in Celsius from the temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula is Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
8.The line printf("%.2f Fahrenheit is equal to %.2f Celsius", fahrenheit, celsius); prints the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, rounded to two decimal places.
9.The last line return 0; returns the value 0 from the function main(), indicating that the program terminated successfully.
